        Hello! This is Pritish Samal, a prefinal year student from National
        Institute of Technology, Rourkela ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ majoring in Ceramic Engineering.
        I&apos;m a Full Stack Developer having experience in MERN Stack, Flask
        and frameworks like Nextjs & Gatsby. I&apos;m also a huge cloud &
        open-source enthusiast who believes in the power of community. Writing
        clean code is and will always be a top priority for me.

      <Text {...textProps}>
        The recent outbreak of the global pandemic, which led to the lockdown,
        has made me a typical computer nerd. So, you&apos;ll rarely find me AFK.
        When I&apos;m not coding, I&apos;ll be busy organising or participating
        in Hackathons, involved in community programs, hosting or attending
        seminars & workshops, writing blogs and solving doubt & mentoring
        students. I also love outdoor sports like football & basketball and have
        a knack of mobile photography.
