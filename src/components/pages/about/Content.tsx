        I&apos;m a passionate <b>Full Stack Developer</b> from ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ with a knack
        for crafting robust applications and contributing to the open-source
        community. Graduating from <b>NIT Rourkela</b> with a degree in{" "}
        <b>Ceramic Engineering</b>, my journey led me to the exciting world of
        technology, where I specialize in MERN Stack, Golang, Java, Python,
        Flask, and frameworks like Next.js & Gatsby. At the moment, I&apos;m
        exploring how we can use{" "}
        <b>Next.js 13 app router, tRPC, Prisma, and Postgre</b>s to create
        impactful solutions.

        In the midst of the pandemic, I immersed myself in coding, organizing
        hackathons, and mentoring students. Now, as a <b>Software Engineer</b>{" "}
        at <b>Harness</b>, I continue to push boundaries, leveraging
        technologies like
        <b>React, TS, Jest, Java, Golang, and Cypress</b>. When I&apos;m not
        coding, you&apos;ll find me on the field playing football or capturing
        moments with my mobile camera.
